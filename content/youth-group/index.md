**Who can become a member of the Youth Group?**

<img src="/img/youth-group/pic1.jpg" class="align-right">Typically, the Youth Group of the Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centre of Toronto - York is made up of the graduates of the 9-year Sathya Sai Education (SSE) classes that are held as part of our regular activities. The idea is that, the Youth Group acts as a 'bridge' between SSE and becoming 'active members' within the Centre. But, anyone between the ages of 16-35, who has the interest to become a member of our youth group can do so.

**Why become a member of the Youth Group?**

<img src="/img/youth-group/pic2.jpg" class="align-left">The main purpose or goal of the entire Youth Group is to strive to become leaders of the future for the individual themselves, the centre, the organization, and the community. As the Alumni of our Youth Group have moved on with their lives, whether it be in their career life or in raising their own families, they have found that the lessons learned and the time spent within the Youth Group growing has been beneficial to them even today.

**What has the Youth Group accomplished to date?**

<img src="/img/youth-group/pic3.jpg" class="align-right">The Youth Group of the Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centre of Toronto - York has a history almost as illustrious as the Centre itself. The Youth Groups' members have always strived to make it a fun and enjoyable experience, but at the same time, know that their efforts are for a greater cause. The Youth Group, over the years, has been involved in such things as: presenting Study Circles to the centre members, assisting the teachers in the children in SSE Classes, conducting and developing the Monthly Youth Devotional Singing Sessions, organizing and contributing to the Centre Newsletter, promoting and maintaining the Centre's Web Site, and preparing items for Bhajan Sandhya, Sri Sathya Sai Baba's Birthday Celebrations, Parent's Day, New Years' Eve Celebrations, participating in the Annual Walk for Values, and building houses for those in need. Two recent centre events that would not have been possible without the Youth Group were the 25th Anniversary Celebrations that occurred in May 2000, and the Journey of Love that was the Centre's Trip to Puttaparthi that occurred during the Summer of 2001. Another accomplishment of the youth group is the establishment of The Care Package Project. The Care Package Project involves the members of the Youth Group collecting various items of need, such as: tooth brushes, toothpaste, winter hats, socks etc. and neatly packaging them into duffle bags or nap sacks, and distributing them throughout Downtown Toronto to the homeless.

**How does the Youth Group contribute to society through the centre?**

<img src="/img/youth-group/pic4.jpg" class="align-left">Another major way the Youth Group contributes to society is through participating in regular centre service activities like: 'Street Patrol', 'Norwood Nursing Home , 'Wheelchair Cleaning Clinics', '416 Project', 'Tree Planting', 'Park Clean-Up' and 'The Annual Walk for Values for the Sathya Sai School (Canada)' on a consistent basis.

**When & where does the Youth Group hold its meetings & activities?**

<img src="/img/youth-group/pic5.jpg" class="align-right">For their regular meetings and activities, the Youth Group meets at the Centre from 9am - 10:30am on Sundays and conduct the centres' devotional singing sessions as "Youth Devotional Singing Sessions" every fourth Sunday of each month from 10:45am - 11:45am. From time to time, the Youth Group conducts meetings and activities outside of this venue and time slot to prepare for events and also to have separate social outings for boys and girls. The motivation behind having separate social outings for boys and girls is for the purpose of allowing the Youth Group members to get to know each other better outside of the centre setting, develop a stronger sense of 'Sai Brotherhood' and 'Sai Sisterhood' amongst thmeselves. Social outings that have been done in the recent past are: Movie Nights, NBA Basketball Games, Picnics, Veggie-Ques, Flag Football Games and Bowling.
