The Sri Sathya Sai Baba Organization is a spiritual one; it recognizes the fundamental unity of all the religions of the world. It has branches in over 137 countries. It is a non-political, non-profit Organization. Its followers are drawn from all races, colours and creeds. In Sai Babas ashram can be found Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Zoroastrians and the followers of other spiritual gurus.

The primary objective of the Organization is to aid seekers in their quest for God by helping them to recognize the divinity in all. The Organization provides a forum where spiritual aspirants learn spiritual values. It is a training ground where members practice the teachings of Sai Baba, with special emphasis on service to others.

The Sri Sathya Sai Organization's aim is to establish the essential unity of all faiths and to propagate through example and practice the principles of Truth (Sathya), Righteousness (Dharma), Peace (Shanthi), Love (Prema) and Non-violence (Ahimsa). The Sathya Sai Organization thus seeks to "awaken in man, the awareness of the Divinity inherent in him".

The basic unit of the Organization is the Centre, which engages in spiritual educational and service activities. The office bearers of a Centre are the president and the three co-ordinators that are responsible for the spiritual, educational and service activities respectively.

Centre members' meet regularly, usually once a week, for conducting devotional sessions, at which several spiritual activities are conducted. These include, devotional singing, prayers, meditation, discourses and study circles on spiritual topics. There are special programs for children on Sai Spiritual Education (SSE)  also known as 'Balvikas'.
