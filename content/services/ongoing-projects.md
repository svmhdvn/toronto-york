**Norwood Nursing Home Visits**

<img src="/img/services/ongoing-projects/pic1.jpg" class="align-right">On the second Sunday of every month the members of our centre entertain residents of Norwood Nursing Home. We sing songs that the residents are familiar with, and encourage them to sing along with us. The singing of such songs brings back good memories for the residents and brightens their day. The Centre's nursing home visits are at Norwood Nursing Home (122 Tyndall Ave.) Both occur on the second Sunday of every month simultaneously from 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM.

**Dry Food Drop Off**

<img src="/img/services/ongoing-projects/pic2.jpg" class="align-left">Every Sunday, our centre members set aside a few items from their personal grocery list to donate to those less fortunate in the Greater Toronto Area. The centre members bring with them to the centre such items as: cereals, pastas, and various canned goods. Once all the donations are gathered up weekly, a member of the Service Wing drops them off to a local area shelter or food bank.

**Wheelchair Cleaning Clinic**

<img src="/img/services/ongoing-projects/pic3.jpg" class="align-right">Approximately every three months we have a wheelchair clinic session at an apartment building and each time it's a different location. The volunteers from our centre, clean approximately 10 to 15 chairs at each location. The wheelchairs are cleaned thoroughly from top to bottom, with all mechanical parts oiled and air tires filled. As the volunteers from our centre worked on the wheelchairs, they conversed with the occupants. The objective of such an exercise is not only to clean the wheelchair, but to make the day enjoyable for the recipient.

**Serving Food**

<img src="/img/services/ongoing-projects/pic4.jpg" class="align-left">This service activity happens twice a month for our members on the 3rd and 4th Saturday of every month at Council Fire, which is located in downtown Toronto. This location was refurbished by our members. The basement was cleaned and the entire hall and kitchen area was repainted and made new, to allow our brothers and sisters in need, to have a nice place to enjoy a decent meal, in each others company. Our members lovingly prepare and serve a hot meal, juice and an ice cream dessert to the needy of that specific community.

**Centre Member Support**

<img src="/img/services/ongoing-projects/pic5.jpg" class="align-right">This project has been started to address the needs of the 'Sai Family' members of our centre. The need could be anything from bereavement within the family, to personal or family problems.
