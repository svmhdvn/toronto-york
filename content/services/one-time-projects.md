**Habitat for Humanity**

<img src="/img/services/one-time-projects/pic1.jpg" class="align-left">Park Clean-up Habitat for Humanity is an international charitable organization that strives to realize the dream of making decent, affordable housing accessible to everyone around the world. In Toronto, many families work hard yet do not earn enough to afford decent housing. They live in substandard conditions, and often pay excessive amounts in rent. Habitat for Humanity Toronto partners with such families, and arranges to build and sell decent homes to these families for a very affordable price. The prices are so low for several reasons. For example: Habitat arranges to purchase land from the government at a reduced rate; much of the cost for buying materials for building is provided by donations; and most of the labour for building the houses is performed by volunteers. Habitat relies on help from dedicated volunteers, in many ways. Since 2004, our centre has helped both in the building of homes (be it building wooden decks, painting, putting up dry-wall, or anything else that's needed), and in providing meals to volunteers on site. We look forward to continuing our work with Habitat.

**Park Clean Up**

<img src="/img/services/one-time-projects/pic2.jpg" class="align-right">Park Clean-up During the Summer and Fall season of every year, the Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centre of Toronto organizes at least four Park Clean up sessions at "James Edward Park" located in Markham, Ontario. This park has been adopted by the Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centre of Toronto, as it?s own to take care of. The clean up is normally arranged on weekends for about 2hrs from 9.00- 11.00 A.M. The volunteers pick up the garbage in and around the park to make it cleaner and environmentally safe for all who use it. This project was originally, and still is, a part of our "Earth Day" celebrations and it is our way of thanking Mother Earth for what she has given us.

**Blood Donation**

<img src="/img/services/one-time-projects/pic3.jpg" class="align-left">The giving of 'Liquid Love' as Bagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba calls it, (a.k.a. Blood Donation), is usually carried out twice a year, once in March and once in September. During the month of September, the clinic is held at 40 Voyager court, hosted by the Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centre of Toronto and organized on a regional level. The date usually coincides with a date given by the International Sai Organization as the 'Global Blood Donation Day'. Whereby all the Sai Centres throughout the world would give blood on this day. This form of service is the most rewarding selfless service you can undertake as you are unaware of the recipient of the blood. Please donate under the Partners For Life **Group ID #SATH011728**.

**Tree Planting**

**Certified CPR Training**

<img src="/img/services/one-time-projects/pic7.jpg" class="align-left">We have had on-going CPR training sessions for our adult and youth members at York University. We have trainers at our centre who have been certified by the Heart and Lung Association to conduct these training sessions. The training sessions usually take 3-4 hours and include a slide show followed by a demonstration and practice session on mannequins, by the trainees. A CPR trained person can be very essential during a time of emergency. It can happen at any time, at any place. Having a CPR certificate can save someone's life. As a result of have the knowledge of CPR training, one of our members saved a person who suffered a heart attack on a parking lot of a 'Canadian Tire'!
