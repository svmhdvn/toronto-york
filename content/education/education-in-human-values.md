**Why is the SSEHV Program important to be a part of?**

<img src="/img/education/education-in-human-values/pic3.jpg" class="align-right">The SSEHV Program is universally relevant and value-based, transcending all cultures and backgrounds. The core human values of Love, Peace, Truth, Righteousness and Non-Violence have formed the basic tenets of human relationships that are shared and recognized worldwide since eternity. In this day and age of political strife and turbulence around the world, the need for developing and inculcating positive values has never been greater, for these values have underpinned the noble thoughts and achievements of mankind throughout history and are an inherent part of the human personality.

The working group is responsible for researching and presenting different topics related to the development of Human Values, study of Human Nature, and the implementation of the SSEHV Program within the surrounding community.
