Centre Membership is open for all those who are spiritual aspirants, have faith in the teachings of Sri Sathya Sai Baba, and are willing to abide by the Nine Point Code of Conduct and Ten Principles and the other regulations of The Sri Sathya Sai Baba International Service Organization.

**How is the SSE Program conducted at the Centre?**
 
<img src="/img/education/spiritual-education/pic2.jpg" class="align-left">The SSE Program, (formerly known as Bal Vikas) was introduced by Sri Sathya Sai Baba in 1969 with the primary purpose of allowing for the total development of good personalities and characters in the children who participate in the program. The SSE Program uses five main teaching techniques, amongst others, in the SSE classes. They are: Silent Sitting, Prayers, Story Telling, Group Activities and Group Singing. All the instructors of the SSE Program are specially trained to conduct the classes the way they were intended to be conducted.

**When & where do the Centre's SSE classes & activities take place?**
 
<img src="/img/education/spiritual-education/pic3.jpg" class="align-right">The SSE classes conducted by The Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centre of Toronto are held at the Centre on Sundays between 9.30am and 11:00am, from September to June. For exact classroom locations please feel free to contact us. Please note, Pre-registration, which usually occurs every August, is required in order for students to attend classes.

Sometimes, the SSE students are involved in plays and presentations for special occasions that are celebrated at the centre. When these occasions occur, the instructors will promptly notify the parents about preparations for them, as to when and where they will be held and any other information required surrounding them.

**Why is the SSE Program an important step for a child?**
 
<img src="/img/education/spiritual-education/pic4.jpg" class="align-left">The premise of the SSE Program is based on a single teaching of Sri Sathya Sai Baba's "The End of Education is Character". The SSE Program promotes the process of creative self-sculpture. This develops in the child, a sense of the 5Ds, namely: Duty, Discipline, Discrimination, Devotion and Determination, which according to Sri Sathya Sai Baba, are essential contributors to humankind living exemplary lives in the global community.

**What are the benefits of attending the SSE Program in its' entirety?**
 
<img src="/img/education/spiritual-education/pic5.jpg" class="align-right">Through regular attendance, parent - teacher co-operation, active participation and practice, the SSE student will develop desirable character traits, healthy positive attitudes, and good study habits up graduating the SSE Program, amongst other positive life changing attributes. The student will further develop self-confidence, humility, courtesy, honesty, kindness etc. In short, the SSE students will learn to practice and promote human values in and through their lives, and in and through to the lives of others.
