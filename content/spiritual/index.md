The Spiritual Wing of the Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centre of Toronto - York serves the same purpose as any of the Spiritual Wings of the Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centres around the world. That is, to promote and emphasize the universal principles and teachings of Sri Sathya Sai Baba, and to allow each individual to transform themselves in a spiritual manner.

These may take the form of monthly study circles, all-day seminars conducted by centre members, and talks from special guest speakers from outside the centre.

<img src="/img/spiritual/spiritual2.jpg" align="right">[Devotional Singing](#) allows for the congregation to jointly recite the many names given to God by all faiths of the world. Devotional singing takes place weekly from 11:15am-12:30pm on Sundays at the Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centre of Toronto - York. All centre members have the opportunity to sing because the centre conducts weekly singing practice Friday between 8 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. to help centre members improve their devotional expression to God.

<img src="/img/spiritual/spiritual3.jpg" align="left">[Celebrations](#) allow for all centre members, from the youngest to the oldest, to utilize whatever talents they may have, in organizing, developing, and maintaining the celebrations which occur on an annual and occasional basis. In doing this, centre members are working towards the common goal of putting Sri Sathya Sai Baba's message into further practice.
