**What is the spiritual significance of Study Circle?**

<img src="/img/spiritual/study-circle/pic1.jpg" class="align-right">Study within a circle is the definition given by Sri Sathya Sai Baba for a study circle. It is not just reading books. Study in a circle means taking up a point and each person discussing what the meaning of that point is to them. Each offers a point of view and finally values are derived from this. In this way there will be not only a sharing of experience but also an appreciation of one another's point of view.

**What is the purpose of Study Circle?**

<img src="/img/spiritual/study-circle/pic1.jpg" class="align-left">The purpose of study circle is to discuss spiritual topics for better understanding and progress in the spiritual field through group discussion. The themes of all our interactive and inspiring Study Circles throughout the year revolve around and recognize the miraculous and transforming nature of the five human values, the cultivation of which gives worthiness to life, enhances its sweetness and beauty and make it fragrant. These five basic human values uinder which all other values can be grouped are: Truth, Right Conduct, Peace, Love, and Non-Violence.

**When and Where do Study Circles take place?**

The Study Circle is conducted at the [Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centre of Toronto - York](#). Study Circle is held every second Sunday of the month from 9am to 11:00am except during the summer months (July and August) and the month of November, due to Sathya Sai Baba's Birthday.

**How are Study Circles conducted? (i.e. format/forum)**

1. Study Circle Team member requests a devotee(s) to facilitate and conduct a study circle for a given date on a mutually agreed topic. Alternatively any devotee may nominate him/her or other devotee for a study circle.
2. The devotee(s) will assume the role of facilitator during study circle and prepare for the topic. All devotees are encouraged to conduct these sessions. The devotee(s) may ask others to help and may use team approach (i.e. more than one person conducting the same session). Preference is given to youth of the center.

Following format is used to conduct Study Circle Session:

1. Session starts with opening remarks, introduction to topic and outline of session.
2. 3 to 5 Discussion Groups (15 to 30 people each) are formed depending on the number of participants and each group forms a circle.
3. Each group nominates one or more Spokesperson(s). Preference is given to youths.
4. Questions and instructions are distributed to the Spokespersons.
5. Enough time is provided to the groups to discuss questions among group members. The facilitator encourages discussion among all participants by providing relevant information.
6. The Spokesperson(s) from each group then presents the group's response to entire audience and may seek further discussion with audience to clarify the point under discussion.
7. The facilitator presents pre-prepared answers to the questions and encourages further discussion.
8. Session is closed with final closing remarks.

**Why are Study Circles conducted in the way that they are?**

The format of study circle requires active participation of all members of the centre, to allow for maximum benefit to the participants in the understanding of spiritual topics.
