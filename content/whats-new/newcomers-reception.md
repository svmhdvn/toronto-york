Newcomers are defined as: people who are new to any knowledge of Sri Sathya Sai Baba, or people who are enquiring about Him, or devotees who are new to the Greater Toronto Area, to the region, to the Centre, or people who are just visiting, or are the guests of a centre member.

<img src="/img/whats-new/newcomers-reception/pic1.jpg" class="align-right">When a newcomer to the Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centre of Toronto - York has been identified, they are personally received and acknowledged by Newcomer's Reception committee. The newcomers are invited to sit with the volunteers and have a brief friendly chat, have any questions answered, sign the guest book, and take some phamplets of information on Sri Sathya Sai Baba and His work home with them.

<img src="/img/whats-new/newcomers-reception/pic2.jpg" class="align-left">Typically, Newcomer's Reception hosts an evening for newcomers three times a year. They are held once each in the Spring, Summer, and Fall. The sessions are generally held at the private residences of centre members. This provides for a more comfortable setting, which allows for more open and candid discussion to take place about such things as: Sri Sathya Sai Baba Himself, His Teachings and the experiences of those who have been in His Presence and witnessed His Work first hand.

In addition to this, videos are usually viewed about Sathya Sai Baba, The Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centre of Toronto - York, The Sri Sathya Sai Baba International Spiritual Organization, and everyone partakes of a tasty meal together while this is going on.

During these evenings, no attempt is made to encourage any newcomers to join The Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centre of Toronto - York, nor do centre members try to influence any newcomers to become followers of Sri Sathya Sai Baba.

At the end of each of these evenings, as a token of appreciation for attending the evening, all newcomers are presented with books and pictures of Sri Sathya Sai Baba to take with them if they so wish.
